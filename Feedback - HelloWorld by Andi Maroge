I am Andi Maroge
I successfully downloaded and loaded the HelloWorld application onto the Android Studio.
The minimum SDK version is 23 and the targeted SDK version is 27
I tested the app using Pixel 2 emulator on the Android Studio (Android P, API 27)
The app works completely fine
The app also displays properly with the texts aligned in the center
The app displays the required text using TextView
The name of the student is displayed
There is nothing to be improved with the application. It is perfect.
